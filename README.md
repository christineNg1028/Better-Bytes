Welcome to the Better Bytes Healthy Alternative program!

In this program, you can enter your favourite baking recipes and compile them into a <u>recipe book</u>. When you add ingredients, the <u>unhealthy ones are detected</u> and you are able to swap them with <u>alternatives</u> to increase the nutritional value of your overall recipe.



## User's Manual



Before you open the program, it is recommended that you have a .txt file ready for your recipe to be saved into to ensure that your recipes aren’t lost when closing the program. Multiple recipes can be saved to the same file!



#### Opening Screen

On this screen, you will see two buttons, a “New Recipe” button, and a “Recipe Book” button. If this is the first opening of the program, there will not be any recipes in the recipe book, so it is recommended that you press the “New Recipe” button to add a recipe to the program’s temporary recipe book. To learn about the new recipe screen, see **New Recipe Screen**. If you have already added a recipe to the recipe book, then you have been brought back to this screen, giving you the option to either add another recipe once again or view the program’s recipe book that holds all the recipes you have added by pressing the “Recipe Book” button. To learn about the recipe book screen, see **Recipe Book Screen**.

#### New Recipe Screen

On this screen, you will see a text box labeled “Recipe Name” along with a button beside it labeled “Save Name”. You must input the name of your recipe before you can enter any ingredients or measurements. Once the name has been entered and saved, you can enter each ingredient and its measurement (grams) and press the “Add Ingredient” button to add the ingredient and its measurement to the list of ingredients below.

Once you have finished adding all the ingredients for your recipe, you need to press the “Done” button to move on. If any of your ingredients are deemed unhealthy by the program, those ingredients will have red text and the button representing that ingredient will enable. You can’t move on from this screen until you have made a choice regarding all of the highlighted ingredients. To make a choice, you must press one of the unhealthy ingredient buttons and make a choice between the original ingredient and three other alternative ingredient buttons. These alternative ingredients will have small paragraphs below them along with the original ingredient to explain the pros and cons of using the ingredient as well as the measurement change that comes with substituting with that ingredient. Some ingredients have the same alternatives, for ex. Caster Sugar and Granulated Sugar. You verify your choice by pressing select and then continue until all the red buttons become disabled (meaning you can’t press them anymore). Once all of the buttons are disabled, the program will send you directly to the comparison screen and to learn more about it, see **Comparison Screen**.

#### Comparison Screen

On this screen, you will see both versions of your recipe. On the left, you will see the original recipe that you entered and on the right, you will see your new recipe with the alternatives in the place of the old unhealthy ingredients. Below the two versions of the recipe, you will see a statement that says the caloric difference between the original and modified recipes (modified may be more, less, or the same calories). Once you have had the chance to look over your new recipe, you can either save the recipe to the recipe book by pressing the “Save to Recipe Book” button, or you can discard the recipe and return to opening by pressing “Back”. After saving to recipe book, you will be sent back to the opening screen where you can add another recipe or you can view your recipe book. See the **Opening Screen** portion to learn more about the recipe book button.

#### Recipe Book Screen

On this screen, the table of contents holds all the recipes that you have saved. You can press the “Back” button to return to the **Opening Screen**. Pressing the “Clear All Recipes” button will remove all existing recipes from the recipe book. The table of contents is made up of buttons with the same names as the recipes you have created. If you would like to view a recipe you’ve made, save it to a pre-existing .txt file, or remove it from the recipe book, you need to press the recipe name to access the recipe screen. To learn more about the recipe screen, see **Recipe Screen**.

#### Recipe Screen

On this screen, you will be able to see your saved recipe with the choices you have made regarding the healthy alternatives. You can save this recipe to a pre-existing .txt file by pressing the “Save to File” button, which will open a file chooser window. You can save multiple recipes to the same file, *which is then stored in the directory no matter where you put it!* You can also remove the recipe from the book if you wish by pressing the “Remove from Recipe Book” button. If you have decided that you do not want to save to file or remove from recipe book then there is a “Back” button just like in the recipe book screen that will send you back to the **Recipe Book Screen** where you can continue to use the program without having to close it and lose your progress on creating your recipe list.

#### The End

*Remember*: once you close out of the program, your recipes in the recipe book will be lost, so remember to save them to a pre-existing .txt file if you want them to be saved for later use!

Thank you for using Better Bytes!
